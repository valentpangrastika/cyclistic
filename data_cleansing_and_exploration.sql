# Case Study - Cyclistic
## Initial Cleansing and Exploration
We will be using the data from divvytrip that is available on https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.
The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. 
We will be using data from June 2022 to July 2023.

The data is organized in a structured format with rows and columns. 
Each row corresponds to a trip, and every trip is uniquely identified by a field called "ride_id."
Each file contain the following column :
* ride_id               #Ride id - unique
* rideable_type         #Bike type - Classic, Docked, Electric
* started_at            #Trip start day and time
* ended_at              #Trip end day and time
* start_station_name    #Trip start station
* start_station_id      #Trip start station id
* end_station_name      #Trip end station
* end_station_id        #Trip end station id
* start_lat             #Trip start latitude  
* start_lng             #Trip start longitute   
* end_lat               #Trip end latitude  
* end_lat               #Trip end longitute   
* member_casual         #Rider type - Member or Casual  

Our following action involves ensuring that the data is stored correctly and ready for analysis. 
To achieve this, I completed several tasks. 
Initially, I downloaded all 12 zip files and extracted their contents, placing them in a temporary folder on my desktop. 
Additionally, I established subfolders for both the .CSV and .XLS files to maintain original data copies.
For each .XLS file, I followed the subsequent steps:
