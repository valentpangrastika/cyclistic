This repository contains all of my sql queries for this case study.
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are
geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to
any other station in the system anytime.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
